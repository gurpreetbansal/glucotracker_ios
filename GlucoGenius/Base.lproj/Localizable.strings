HealthReport.Content = "<Br /> Hemoglobin information: <Br /><Br /> 1.Hemoglobin value is low: More commonly seen in female, also commonly known as anemia. <Br /> 2.In symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, tarry stool, or blood stool, it is recommended to go to the hospital for further examination. <Br /> 3.It is recommended to consume more iron rich and protein rich foods, and also vitamin-C, it helps iron absorption. <Br /> 4.Hemoglobin value is high: Blood is concentrated, and harder to flow. It is recommended to go to hospital for further examination. <Br /><Br /> Glucose information: <Br /><Br /> When BGL value is too low or too high, <Br /> 1.First check that the smart sensor is used under suitable testing conditions.<Br /> 2.Blood glucose should not be lower than 100mg/dL, it is recommended to replenish body sugar by eating piece of candy and cookie to avoid low blood sugar. <Br /> 3.Blood glucose should not be above 300mg/dL, make sure no symptoms such as dizziness or vomiting occur. Drink plenty of water and test again after one hour. <Br /> 4.If blood glucose is above 300 mg/dL, it is recommended to go hospital for further examination.<Br /><Br /> Pulse information: <Br /><Br /> When Pulse value is low or high, <Br /> 1.Pulse value is low: lower than 60bpm, commonly seen in atrioventricular block or increased intracranial pressure. <Br /> 2.Pulse value is high: more than 100bpm, commonly seen in fever, anemia, or coronary heart diseases. <Br /> 3.It is usually companied with other physical symptoms, it is recommended to go hospital for further examination.<Br /><Br /> Blood Flow Velocity information: <Br /><Br /> 1. BFV value is denoted as the unit time flown through a section of the blood vessel, also called ‘volume rate’.<Br /> 2.Arterial blood flow is affected by systolic and diastolic heartbeat. Systolic heartbeat speeds up the blood flow, and diastolic heartbeat slows down the blood flow.<Br /> 3.When blood vessel is elastic, blood flow is slower; When blood vessel becomes stuff, blood flow will be significantly faster.<Br /> 4.We can use the values derived from this testing to compare the blood flow of a person of similar age, and therefore deduce whether the person’s blood vessel is aged faster than the actual person’s age. <Br /><Br /> How to keep your blood vessels elastic:<Br /><Br /> 1.Maintain constant exercise <Br /> 2.Maintain balanced nutrition intake such as proteins and vitamins <Br />3.Regulate three highs: blood glucose, blood pressure, and blood fat.<Br /> 4.Drink enough water daily to reduce blood vessel stickiness.<Br /><Br /> Oxygen Saturation(SpO2) Information:<Br /><Br /> 1.Less than 94%: Lack of Oxygen.<br /> 2.Less than 90%: Hypoxemia. <Br /> 3.In case of SpO2 less than 90%, and shows symptoms of stuffy chest, fatigue and difficulty in breathing, it is recommended to go to hospital for examination.";
